The longest common subsequence LCS problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).
This problem is a classic computer science problem, the basis of data comparison programs such as the diff utility, and has applications in computational linguistics and bioinformatics.
It is also widely used by revision control systems such as Git for reconciling multiple changes made to a revision-controlled collection of files.
The LCS problem has an optimal substructure: the problem can be broken down into smaller, simple subproblems, which can be broken down into yet simpler subproblems, and so on, until, finally, the solution becomes trivial.
The subproblems become simpler as the sequences become shorter. Shorter sequences are conveniently described using the term prefix.
